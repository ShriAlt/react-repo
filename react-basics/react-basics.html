<!-- react is an external libary that allows us to build user interfaces using components. it provides a way to create reusable UI components and manage the state of our application efficiently. react uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering and improve performance. it is widely used for building web applications and has a large community of developers and resources available.

 babel is a transpiler that converts jsx to js 

jsx is a syntax extension for js that allows us to write html like code in js files. it makes it easier to create and manage the user interface of our react applications.

querySelector is a method that allows us to select an element from the DOM using a CSS selector. in this case, we are selecting the element with the class name 'js-container' and storing it in the variable 'container'.

createRoot is a method from the ReactDOM library that creates a root for rendering a React component. it takes a DOM element as an argument and returns a root object.

render is a method of the root object that renders a React component into the DOM. in this case, we are rendering a simple string 'Welcome to SuperSimpleDev React Course' into the container element we selected earlier.

DOM stands for Document Object Model, which is a programming interface for web documents. it represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects, allowing developers to manipulate and interact with the content and structure of the page using JavaScript.

web browsers does not understand jsx syntax, so we need to use babel to transpile our jsx code into regular JavaScript that browsers can understand.
